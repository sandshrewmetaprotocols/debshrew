## Current Status

We have made significant progress on the debshrew project. The core architecture is in place, and we have implemented the key components:

1. **WASM Runtime**: We have implemented a WASM runtime based on the subrail approach, which can execute transform modules and handle CDC message generation and rollback.

2. **Transform Module Interface**: We have defined the `DebTransform` trait and implemented the necessary host functions for transform modules to interact with the host environment.

3. **CDC Message Handling**: We have implemented CDC message generation and automatic rollback generation for chain reorganizations.

4. **Block Synchronization**: We have implemented a block synchronizer that can process blocks, handle reorgs, and send CDC messages to sinks.

5. **CDC Sinks**: We have implemented the CDC sink interface and provided console and file sink implementations.

The next steps are to complete the metashrew client implementation, add additional CDC sink implementations, and perform comprehensive testing of the WASM runtime. We also need to implement a configuration system for transform modules and a CLI interface for debshrew.

## Known Issues

1. **Deep Reorgs**: The current implementation can handle reorgs up to the block cache size (default: 6 blocks). Deeper reorgs will require special handling.

2. **WASM Performance**: The WASM runtime may have performance issues with complex transform modules. We need to optimize the runtime for better performance.

3. **CDC Sink Reliability**: Different sinks have different reliability characteristics. We need to implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers for failing sinks.

4. **Metashrew Dependency**: Debshrew depends on metashrew for data. We need to implement connection pooling and retry mechanisms for metashrew.

## Next Milestones

1. **Complete Metashrew Client**: Implement a complete metashrew client that can handle all the necessary view calls.

2. **Additional CDC Sinks**: Implement Kafka and PostgreSQL sink implementations.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Develop a comprehensive test suite for the WASM runtime and transform modules.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the WASM runtime for better performance.

5. **Configuration System**: Implement a configuration system for transform modules.

6. **CLI Interface**: Implement a CLI interface for debshrew.

7. **Documentation and Examples**: Create comprehensive documentation and examples for debshrew.
